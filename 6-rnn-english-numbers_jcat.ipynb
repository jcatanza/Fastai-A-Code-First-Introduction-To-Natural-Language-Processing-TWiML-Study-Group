    "Jeremy created this synthetic dataset to have a better way to check if things are working, to debug, and to understand what was going on. When experimenting with new ideas, it can be nice to have a smaller dataset to do so, to quickly get a sense of whether your ideas are promising (for other examples, see [Imagenette and Imagewoof](https://github.com/fastai/imagenette)) This English word numbers will serve as a good dataset for learning about RNNs.  Our task today will be to predict which word comes next when counting."
