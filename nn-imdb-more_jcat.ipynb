       "  xxmaj also known under the slightly different tile xxmaj airport 1977 this second sequel to the smash - hit disaster thriller xxmaj airport ( 1970 ) was directed by xxmaj jerry xxmaj jameson & while once again like it 's predecessors i ca n't say xxmaj airport ' 77 is any sort of forgotten classic it is entertaining although not necessarily for the right reasons . xxmaj out of the three xxmaj airport films i have seen so far i actually liked this one the best , just . xxmaj it has my favourite plot of the three with a nice mid - air hi - jacking & then the crashing ( did n't he see the oil rig ? ) & sinking of the 747 ( maybe the makers were trying to cross the original xxmaj airport with another popular disaster flick of the period xxmaj the xxmaj poseidon xxmaj adventure ( 1972 ) ) & submerged is where it stays until the end with a stark dilemma facing those trapped inside , either suffocate when the air runs out or drown as the 747 floods or if any of the doors are opened & it 's a decent idea that could have made for a great little disaster flick but bad unsympathetic character 's , dull dialogue , lethargic set - pieces & a real lack of danger or suspense or tension means this is a missed opportunity . xxmaj while the rather sluggish plot keeps one entertained for 108 odd minutes not that much happens after the plane sinks & there 's not as much urgency as i thought there should have been . xxmaj even when the xxmaj navy become involved things do n't pick up that much with a few shots of huge ships & helicopters flying about but there 's just something lacking here . xxmaj george xxmaj kennedy as the jinxed airline worker xxmaj joe xxmaj patroni is back but only gets a couple of scenes & barely even says anything preferring to just look worried in the background . \n",

       "  xxmaj the home video & theatrical version of xxmaj airport ' 77 run 108 minutes while the xxup us xxup tv versions add an extra hour of footage including a new opening credits sequence , many more scenes with xxmaj george xxmaj kennedy as xxmaj patroni , flashbacks to flesh out character 's , longer rescue scenes & the discovery or another couple of dead bodies including the navigator . xxmaj while i would like to see this extra footage i am not sure i could sit through a near three hour cut of xxmaj airport ' 77 . xxmaj as expected the film has dated badly with horrible fashions & interior design choices , i will say no more other than the toy plane model effects are n't great either . xxmaj along with the other two xxmaj airport sequels this takes pride of place in the xxmaj razzie xxmaj award 's xxmaj hall of xxmaj shame although i can think of lots of worse films than this so i reckon that 's a little harsh . xxmaj the action scenes are a little dull unfortunately , the pace is slow & not much excitement or tension is generated which is a shame as i reckon this could have been a pretty good film if made properly . \n",

       "  xxmaj airport ' 77 is the most disaster orientated of the three xxmaj airport films so far & i liked the ideas behind it even if they were a bit silly , the production & bland direction does n't help though & a film about a sunken plane just should n't be this boring or lethargic . xxmaj followed by xxmaj the xxmaj concorde ... xxmaj airport ' 79 ( 1979 ) .,xxbos xxmaj this film lacked something i could n't put my finger on at first : charisma on the part of the leading actress . xxmaj this inevitably translated to lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading man . xxmaj even the romantic scenes came across as being merely the actors at play . xxmaj it could very well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors . i just do n't know . \n",
